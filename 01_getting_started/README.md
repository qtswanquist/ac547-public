# Getting Started

## Software installation and account set up

Before you get started in the course, you will need to install some software and set up a couple of accounts. Below are step-by-step instructions for each program and license. These instructions are tailored to students at the University of Alabama, but should be adaptable for students at other universities.

### GitHub and GitHub Copilot 

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It is where you will find many of the course materials. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered tool that helps you write code faster and with fewer errors. GitHub provides free access to these tools for educational users (shout out to GitHub!). You will need to sign up for a GitHub account and apply for educational access. **Please note** that this process can take a few days, so it is best to start this as soon as possible!

1. To get set up on GitHub, start by going here: <a href="https://github.com/education/students" target="_blank">GitHub Education</a>. Then select **Join GitHub education** and then **create an account**.
2. Enter your **crimson.ua.edu email** and select a password and username.
3. Complete human verification (if necessary) and input the verification code from your email.
4. Login to your newly created account:
   1. Under **billing and licensing** select **payment information**. Or go to [billing information](https://github.com/settings/billing/payment_information). Ensure your name is listed exactly as it is on your university records.
   2. Enter billing information consistent with your university records (you do not need to enter any payment information). 
   3. Under **password and authentication** enable two-factor authentication. Or go to [password and authentication](https://github.com/settings/security). You will need to use an authenticator app on your phone or SMS messaging.
5. Under **billing and licensing** select **education benefits**. Or go to [education benefits](https://github.com/settings/education/benefits). Then start an application. Ensure "student" is selected as well as “University of Alabama – Tuscaloosa” at the bottom of the page and click continue.
6. To verify your status as a student, GitHub needs proof of enrollment. Login to <a href="https://mybama.ua.edu" target="_blank">MyBama</a> and search/select “Enrollment Verification.” Ensure that all relevant boxes are checked (name, term, current semester, graduation date).
7. Select **save and print** and save the generated PDF to your computer. Next, take a snapshot (screen grab) or a picture of the document and upload to GitHub for verification. 
   1. In some cases, this may take a couple of tries.  Some students have reported success with uploading a zoomed-in and clear picture from their phone. Other students have reported success uploading a screenshot of their student ID from the ACT Card/eAccounts mobile app.
8. During verification, you may be asked to share your location. If you are not on campus yet, select "classes haven't started yet." Then submit your enrollment verification as evidence.
9. GitHub should respond within a week with access to the education package. If you receive an instant email rejection, try to follow the instructions on the rejection email to troubleshoot.

### Python

In this course, we will rely primarily on Python for data analysis.

1. To install Python for this course, start by going here: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python</a>. 
2. Select **Download Python** for the latest release (e.g., version 3.13.5) for your operating system (e.g., Windows).
3. Open the file from your downloads and follow installation instructions (leaving default options where applicable). 

### JetBrains and DataSpell

JetBrains makes a suite of popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). DataSpell is a JetBrains IDE specifically designed for data science and analytics. JetBrains provides free access to their tools for educational users (shout out to JetBrains!), you will need to sign up for JetBrains and apply for education access.

#### Sign up for a JetBrains account for educational use
1. To get set up on JetBrains, start by going here: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students" target="_blank">JetBrains Education</a>
2. Navigate to **apply now** or **request now**. 
3. Complete the human verification (if necessary) and fill in the application using your **crimson.ua.edu email**. Alternatively, if you have already been approved for GitHub education, you can use the **GitHub** option to sign up for JetBrains.
4. Navigate to your email and follow the link from JetBrains to verify your email address. Click **get started**.
5. Accept the license agreement and navigate to your email to find a second link titled **link your free license**. 
6. Select continue with email and enter in your crimson email.
7. Follow the prompt to select a password using the verification code sent to your email.
8. Create a password for your account.

#### Download and install DataSpell
1. After setting up your JetBrains account, you can download DataSpell by going here: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/" target="_blank">DataSpell</a>.
2. Select **download**.
3. On the next page select your operating system (e.g., MacOS, Windows) and select **download**. 
4. Select the installer from your downloads and follow the prompts to install DataSpell (using default options where applicable).
5. Once installed, open DataSpell in your applications and agree to the terms.
6. When asked for a license, select the **log into JetBrains** option and it will take you to a browser where you can log into your account for JetBrains.
7. Once authorized, navigate back to DataSpell and click **activate**. 
8. Upon opening DataSpell for the first time, if it asks you to hide DataSpell from your antivirus software, select yes.
9. You can allow JetBrains AI as part of your subscription. This will allow you to use JetBrains AI tools. This is optional but **strongly encouraged**. To activate the JetBrains tools, they require payment information (though you have free access through the educational license).
10. Once in the application, click the settings "gear icon" (⚙) near the top right corner and select **plugins**. Search or find the **GitHub Copilot** plugin and install it. Once complete, you may be prompted to restart DataSpell. Once installed, you will see a GitHub Copilot icon in the top right corner of the DataSpell window. If you select it, you will be prompted to log into GitHub and link your account.

If you made it here, you are ready to start the course! On the first day, we will run through the [Getting Started](getting_started.ipynb) exercise.
